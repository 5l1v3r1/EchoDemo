## Echo Demo Software

### About Echo Demo
----------------------

Echo is a scripted data analysis environment that replaces conventional 
data types such as arrays of numbers and strings with objects that contain 
data, metadata, and provenance. By encapsulating metadata with data, Echo 
removes the opportunity for many human errors in indexing and reporting, 
and it enables analysts’ scripts to indicate their intent much more clearly 
than in traditional scripting environments. Echo dramatically increases 
analyst efficiency, preventing errors, and saving time.

Echo Demo provides a collection of tools for interacting with Echo datasets
intended for evaluation purposes including:
- EchoTrial: A restricted version of the full MATLAB-based Echo software
- EchoPlot: PC and Mac supported graphical interface for read-only exploration
  and visualization of Echo datasets and databases
- EchoH5.py: Python package for reading EchoH5 formatted datasets

EchoTrial and EchoPlot both include example time series data for evaluating
the software or can be used with your own data. To get started, new users
should start with the tutorial sequence included in the help menu of EchoTrial.
